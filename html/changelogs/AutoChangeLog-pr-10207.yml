changes: 
  - rscadd: "Reverts back to the bubblegum before [#38306](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/pull/38306), was an unfinished pr and generally this bubblegum has more stuff to work with."
  - rscadd: "Enrage mode, while in this mode bubblegum is colored a deep red, moves faster, doesn't retreat, and is immune to projectiles. All while throwing out ground slam attacks around him that throw people around."
  - rscadd: "Clones, basically fake bubblegums that do one attack and disappear afterwards."
  - rscadd: "Ground slam attack, only happens when bubblegum is enraged, throws enemies around. Beware being thrown into a wall or you might be stunned because this is how throws work in this game."
  - rscadd: "Bubblegum can now continue to charge through enemies without stopping."
  - rscdel: "Bubblegum's anger modifier no longer determines his movement speed, instead having a constant speed and changing on enragement."
  - tweak: "Blood spray is now a directional move and can move diagonally towards its target"
  - tweak: "Bubblegums charge no longer uses throws to calculate being hit."
  - balance: "Bubblegum now retreats in his standard phase while not using moves, generally he was hard to get hit by in this phase anyways so this is a much smarter play on his part."
  - balance: "Blood spray can now move through walls and goes further, this was pretty easily cheesed because it couldn't move through walls with just hugging the edges of walls and just made him too hard to balance."
  - balance: "Bubblegum now procs melee checks much more often, though he has the same cooldown for his melee attacks. This means you're much less likely to stand next to him and not get hit."
  - balance: "Bubblegum now charges 2 tiles past you, makes it slightly more difficult to predict where he's going to go and makes it so he can catch up to you easier."
  - balance: "Bubblegum now moves faster during his charge."
  - balance: "Bubblegum now only takes 50 damage from explosions, taking many bombs to kill him instead of just 10."
